## <span style="color: #66B2FF"> Introduction </span>
This is a simple website that I created to showcase my portfolio. It's a project that I did on the side to practise front-end web development. <br><br>
Special shoutout to **How to Become a Developer** whose tutorial I based this website around. <br>
The link for the tutorial is as follows: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldwlOzRvYOU)
